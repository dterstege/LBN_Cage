3D Printing
===========

To print cage components, download the contents of this folder and slice appropriately.

Throughout the development process and the use of these cages, a Creality Ender3 V2 printer was used.

Components were sliced using Ultimaker Cura (V4.8).  20% infill and the default supports were used.

Print Specifications:

- 1.75 mm PLA
- 0.6 mm brass nozzle tip
- Tempered glass plate (stock) build surface (235 x 235 mm)
- Build plate temperature: 60°C
- Nozzle temperature: 200°C

Multi-component features, such as the lid and the grid, were adhered together by carefully applying a thin layer of acetone to common surfaces.

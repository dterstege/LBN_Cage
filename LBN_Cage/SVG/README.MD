Laser Cutting
=============

To cut cage components, download the contents of this folder and arrange them appropriately.

Throughout the development process and the use of these cages, a PLACEHOLDER was used.

Components were arranged to suit the dimenstions of the acrylic sheets using Inkscape (V0.92.4).

Cut Specifications:

- PLACEHOLDER

Components were adhered together by carefully applying a thin layer of PLACEHOLDER to junctions.

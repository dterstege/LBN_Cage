LBN CAGE
========

The Limited Bedding and Nesting (LBN) paradigm can be used to study the effects of exposure to early life stress.  In this paradigm, dams have limited access to nesting and bedding.  These less than ideal conditions induce stress and alter maternal behaviours.

This repository contains the build instructions for cages applying the LBN paradigm.  Cages were designed by Dylan Terstege, a Neuroscience PhD candidate in the Epp Lab at the University of Calgary.

Current Version: V1.0.0

## 1. 3D Printing

To print the appropriate components, navigate to the [STL folder](https://github.com/dterstege/LBN_Cage/tree/main/LBN_Cage/STL) and download its contents.

Throughout the development process and the use of these cages, a Creality Ender3 V2 printer was used.

Components were sliced using Ultimaker Cura (V4.8).  20% infill and the default supports were used.

Print Specifications:

- 1.75 mm PLA
- 0.6 mm brass nozzle tip
- Tempered glass plate (stock) build surface (235 x 235 mm)
- Build plate temperature: 60°C
- Nozzle temperature: 200°C

Multi-component features, such as the lid and the grid, were adhered together by carefully applying a thin layer of acetone to common surfaces.

## 2. Laser Cutting

To cut the appropriate components, nativate to the [SVG folder](https://github.com/dterstege/LBN_Cage/tree/main/LBN_Cage/SVG) and download its contents.

Components were arranged to suit the dimenstions of the acrylic sheets using Inkscape (V0.92.4).

Components were cut from 1/4" transparent plexiglass using a Boss Laser LS-2440 CO2 Laser Cutter and Engraver

Components were adhered together by carefully applying a thin layer of Weld-On #3 acrlyic solvent cement to junctions.
